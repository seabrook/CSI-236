A. Things to do

   1. Create your own user account and group if you have not
                 done so already
   2. Create accounts for Grumby corp
         Grumby Corp., a local R&D firm, requests you to
      create accounts on your installation for their 
      software developers in the Applications and Systems
      devisions.  There are three people in each division
      and one division chair who manages both divisions.
      Here are the employees:
              Raymond P. Cartou, Manager
              Sally M. Bates, Applications

      and files
