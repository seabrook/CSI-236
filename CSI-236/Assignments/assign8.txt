Spring 2011            Assignment 8: Backup

A. Things to do
   1. Backup your home directory tree to another partition
      on the local machine as follows:
      - create a new directory /BACKUP
      - create a new subdirectory /BACKUP/homes
      - use rsync to backup your home directory tree to the new
        partition: rsync -av /home/whoever /BACKUP/homes
      - note that the -v option generates a verbose listing
      - check to make sure everything got there

   2. Set the local backup to update hourly using cron:
      - create a mybackup script that performs the same backup
        as above and install it in cron.hourly -- see example below. 
        Be sure to set permissions to 755
      - create a new file in your home directory and make sure
        it turns up in the backup tree an hour later.  You can
        always reset the clock if you don't want a long wait but
        be sure to set it back again.
         
   3. [Experimental] Backup your home directory tree to another 
      machine in the local network.  We will use the instructor's
      workstation to set this up -- IP address to be provided.
      Use the same source directory as above and for destination
      use studentN@IPaddress with password "grumble1" where N is 
      your number I gave you in the first class.  After the backup
      use rsync again to check to see if the files got there, for 
      example rsync studentN@IPaddress:/BACKUP/homes/studentN/*
      -- pulls a directory listing from machine at IPaddress.

   4. You can use your CD/DVD or a USB device to roll 
      out your backup directory tree to an external medium.  In a 
      typical situation you would use tar and gzip to create a
      single writeable file and cdrecord to send it out.  
      However, for this exercise, just do the following:
      -- list the characteristics of your CD/DVD drive with 
          cdrecord -prcap
      -- list your USB devices with lsusb
      -- cat the contents of your /proc/bus/usb/devices file.

B. Things to turn in: -- backupex.txt
   1. listing of your partition table
   2. listing of your home directory and your
            your /BACKUP/homes home directory
   3. [If we get it set up] listing of your
      /BACKUP/homes/studentN directory on the 
      instructor's workstation
   4. listing of your cron.hourly directory
   5. listing of your CD/DVD drive capabilities with
            cdrecord -prcap and your USB devices info
C. File this Lab with your documentation after I return it.
D. Backup script handout:
#!/bin/sh
rsync -a /home/whoever /BACKUP/homes
exit 0
